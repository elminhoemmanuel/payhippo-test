### Introduction

In this document I will be explaining some of the important decisions I have taken during the execution of this work as well as provide some good documentation about my completed solution.

## Features

I have been able to do a rebuild of the current Payhippo sign up flow bearing in mind the key attributes of the average customer given ;

- Older
- Business-oriented
- Enjoy simple on-boarding flows
- Mix of both savvy and non-tech savvy users
- Most use mobile

Therefore I have reduced the number of steps involved in the regisytration process to make it more easier to be quickly done with as well as ensure it is responsive as a good number of users make use of mobile devices.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
